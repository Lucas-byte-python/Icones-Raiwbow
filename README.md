# ðŸŒˆ About the Project: Icones-Raiwbow

<br>

## The Icones-Raiwbow project is a simple and creative visual demonstration built with HTML and CSS, featuring three icons with a glowing neon effect.

## The main idea is to apply colorful, rainbow-style glow animations to the icons, creating a modern and eye-catching look. This project is non-functional â€” it serves purely as a visual showcase, ideal for studying CSS visual effects, especially shadows, transitions, and vibrant colors.

## Itâ€™s a great reference for anyone looking to explore creative styling and learn how to work with dynamic and colorful interface elements.
